## Short Description
**Gadget Heaven** is an engaging React-based e-commerce platform powered by React Router DOM, designed for users to easily browse and purchase a wide range of electronic gadgets, including laptops, mobiles, iPhones, MacBooks, accessories, and smartwatches. The site features a user-friendly category selection for seamless navigation. Additionally, Gadget Heaven includes a dedicated "Trouble" section where users can report issues or share feedback via contact or email. It also provides a branch route that lists all branch locations and their contact numbers, ensuring comprehensive support for customers.

## Problem I Have Faced
During the development of **Gadget Heaven**, I encountered several challenges that tested my skills and perseverance. React Router DOM was new to me, making routing difficult at first. I also faced a frustrating 404 error when reloading the deployed link on Surge, which hindered access to the site. Additionally. Furthermore, I used the Context API for handling data for the first time, which was tough but ultimately rewarding. Despite these obstacles, I overcame them with determination and effort, Alhamdulillah.
